# Tools, Scanners, Malware Analysis, Oh My!

This repo will be dedicated for the public and myself to add more tools and websites to their aresenal. I will try to constantly update this throughout my career. I'll post tools that I've primarily had hands on with, because there are so many out there, its quite difficult to use them all.

## ISP, IP, Domain Searchers

[shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)

[google.com](https://www.google.com)

[urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/) - Check the landing page of a website before actually clicking on it.

[zoominfo] for example type this into google "[companyname]@zoominfo" - I used this in intelligence to confirm domains.

[Pure Signal Recon](https://www.team-cymru.com/advanced-persistent-threat-reconnaissance) - This was recommended by Kent Backman of Dragos. It's paid, so I haven't had personal hands on it.
